### Subject

Chef Amit is confronted to a big problem: due to his incredible number of bookings, maintaining a count of everything he has in his huge kitchen became a pain.
He would like a web application to help him managing an inventory of all the ingredients he posseses.

Build a small application to help chef Amit managing his stock.
He is not really interested in a beautiful app, he just needs something simple and functionnal.
He wants to be able to:
- add ingredients to his inventory
- deal with quantities
- change the name of his ingredients in case he mispelled it
- remove the ingredients he has already used for cooking


### Constraints

The backend must use our node.js application. Sadly, it is very basic and dirty… you will have to improve it by your own means.

You must write your own database management system to store the inventory. The data must be stored on the server. The data composition and the file(s) format are totally up to you.

You can use whatever you want for the GUI (but it musts be javascript based and in the browser).
