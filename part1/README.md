# Context

Chef Amit is confronted to a big problem: due to his incredible number of bookings, maintaining a count of everything he has in his huge kitchen became a pain.
He would like a web application to help him manage an inventory of all the ingredients he possesses.

He wants to be able to:

* add ingredients to his inventory
* deal with quantities
* change the name of his ingredients in case he ~~mispelled~~ misspelled them
* remove the ingredients he has already used for cooking

He likes his applications to be intuitive :)

# What we ask for

* Build a small application to help chef Amit manage his stock.
* This application must use an express.js-based API server.
* You can simply use plain javascript objects for storage, but as we use MongoDB at La Belle Assiette, it would make sense that your demo app uses it as well for bonus points!
* For the web application, use any framework you feel most comfortable with. However, in the same spirit, as we use React.js, AngularJS (1.X), and jQuery, bonus points if you demonstrate your ability to use one of those. But don't bother learning a new framework just for this demo app, use whatever you already know (it'll be faster) and we'll be able to judge from that :)
* No need to spend time on design. Plain Bootstrap is plenty enough. However, we'd appreciate a good UX!

The data structures and the file(s) format are totally up to you. Feel free to split (or not) the API server and the main application (two repositories).

You can use a bootstrap/generator to kickstart your app (e.g. create-react-app). We do however care about every file that you'll turn in, so don't create bloat (unused files/config).

When you're done, share your code with @saveman71 on GitHub.

# Bonus

* Handle uncountable ingredients as well (milk, olive oil, etc.)
* Handle multiple inventories

# Final word

Don't spend too much time on this, really. If you feel like you have something that accurately represents what you can do, but don't have the time to polish it, it's okay, we'll accommodate.
