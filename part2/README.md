### Subject

Now that chef Amit knows what he has in his possession, he finds it quite useless because he doesn’t know what recipes he can cook and for how many people.

Amit sent us a list of the recipes he uses to cook. He would like you to improve your app to tell him what are the recipes he can cook with his current stock.
The app will ask him for how many guests he wants to cook and display the recipes that are available.

Bonuses:
- display also recipes that are not available, with the missing ingredients, placing the most relevant recipes at the top
- manage the ingredients expiration date

/!\ Warning /!\ the required ingredients don’t always depend on the number of people you want to cook for!

### Constraints

You will find the different recipes in the recipes folder.
The constraints are the same than part 1’s.
