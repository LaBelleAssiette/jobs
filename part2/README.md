### Subject

Now that chef Amit is able to monitor ingredients in his possession, he would also like to know what he can make out of it.

Amit sent us a list of the recipes he uses to cook. He would like you to improve your app to tell him what are the recipes he can cook with his current stocks.

### Constraints

Reuse and upgrade your work for part 1.

You will find recipes in the recipes folder, create your own to make your app funnier and more personnalized.

### Bonus

- deal with not quantity based ingredients
- consume quantity based ingredients when cooking a recipe
- display also recipes for which ingredients are missing
- display missing ingredients in these recipes
- sort it by relevance (how many ingredients are missng)
- allow filtering recipes on preparation and cooking time
- have fun & be creative :)
