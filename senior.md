# Senior Engineer case study

The base repository is here: https://github.com/LaBelleAssiette/jobs-kickstart

## Create a "private fork" of the base repository

The base repository is public for practical reasons, but your work should be private for obvious
reasons. Follow this to create a private repository and get the base repo in place: https://stackoverflow.com/a/30352360/2367848

## Invite LBA team members

Invite @vidjul and @saveman71 to your private repo so we'll be able to review your future changes.

## The assignment

All the modifications you make should be on another branch. You then create a pull request to _your own_ repository so we can review your changes.

You should keep a log book of items that are not in the scope of the assignments (we'll let you figure out the best medium) but that you notice, and could be improved.

### Setting up

Set up a locally working environment. If you have some trouble, your assignment is to get stuff working. Amend the README(s).md accordingly if insturctions are out of date / missing.

### Seeding

Add a script that seeds the database with 42 ingredients. This eases development and will be useful later on.

### Fixing emojis

Emojis appear to be broken ðŸ¤”. Would be nice if it worked again no?

### Pagination

Add pagination. The search should still behave correctly. A page size of 10 items should be good.

### Responsiveness

Amend the style a bit so the responsiveness of the app is better. No need for a full scale mobile app but a few tweeks so the table is more readable and the form is displayed better.

## Request a review

Once you're done, request a review from us via GitHub and notify your contact at LBA.
